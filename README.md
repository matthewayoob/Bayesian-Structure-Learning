# Bayesian-Structure-Learning

This project involves finding the best Bayesian network structures for three provided datasets: titanic, wine, and a secret black box. The evaluation of the structures will be based on the Bayesian score, as described in the course textbook. The datasets have been pre-processed to use discrete variables for simplicity.

There are three datasets:

small.csv with 8 variables.
medium.csv with 12 variables.
large.csv with 50 variables.
Your project is to find the Bayesian network structure that yields the highest Bayesian score for each dataset. To participate, you need to develop a program that takes one of these datasets as input and outputs a file containing the network structure. The output filename should be the same as the input filename but with a .gph extension (e.g., small.gph).

The success of your project will be determined based on the quality of the Bayesian network structures you produce. The results will be posted on the course website after the due date. Make sure to adhere to the specified late policy for submitting your project. For code and additional details, you can refer to the provided starter code in the AA228-CS238-Student repository.
